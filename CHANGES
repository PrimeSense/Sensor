Detailed Change log:
--------------------

Version 5.1.0.25 (Unstable version - Dec 18th 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
  * Bug Fix: server-client didn't always work due to an uninitialized member.
  * Installer bug fix: versions were compared by string instead of by number.
  * Added Support for FW 5.5:
    1) Support product ID 0601.
	2) ISO and BULK interfaces are now switched.
	3) AudioGenerator is no longer supported.
  * Enumeration Bug Fix: From now on, a generator will not return on enumeration if one already exists from the same device.
  * Android: makefiles now match ndk v7.
  * Bug Fix: client-server did not pass timestamp correct in the NewDataAvailbale event, causing FrameSync to malfunction.
  * Bug Fix: Enumeration for ImageGenerator could cause a crash.
  * Default UsbInterface is now BULK on Arm (for performance reasons) and ISO on all other platforms.
  * Default Image format is now uncompressed in ISO, and compressed in BULK.
  * Server (Multiprocess) is not on by default on Arm.
  * BC Bug fix: XnVInitStreamPropertiesInternal::IsProperty did not function correctly. 
  * BC Bug Fix: XnVDepthRepresentation would not set correct Y resolution.
  * Added support for FW 5.6 (no audio)
  * Added Android support to open source.
  * Temporary patch for MacOSX: Cache the device path's since running enum on the MAC takes several seconds!  

Version 5.0.5.1 (Unstable version - Nov 17th 2011)
--------------------------------------------------
  * Removed support for very old 2.0 devices.
  * Linux: XnSensorServer dependency was missing.
  * Bug Fix: AllowMultiUsers property was not handled correctly.

Version 5.0.4.4 (Unstable version - Nov 7th 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
  * Added YUV input in high res for FW 5.3.28 and above.
  * Added grayscale 8 input format.
  * Added automatic setting of input format, and automatic checking of modes.
  * Updated to newer common makefiles
  * Sensor client-server on windows: Allow starting server and client in different sessions (requires a special setting in GlobalDefaults.ini, as this causes things not to work properly if running on a machine with UAC on).
  * Changed Engine changed to Sensor in the final installation files.
  * Renamed Linux-x86 to "Linux" (supports x86, x64, Arm and MacOSX).
  * Allow better cross compiling.
  * Bug Fix: old XNS files would not set their IsGenerating property (and so it is left FALSE, even if node has frames).
  * Updated the value of the UsbInterface property once endpoints are opened.

Version 5.0.4.3 (Stable version - Sep 18th 2011)
------------------------------------------------
  * Some minor windows installer UI fix (title position).
  * Fixed buffer overflow bugs in the software registration.
  * Support for firmware 5.4.x: New TEC and extended serial number commands.
  * On newer FWs (5.4+) high-res image output does not always have to be bayer so this rule will only be enforced on older versions.
  * Preliminary Android Support.
  * Preliminary ARM Support.
  * Win32: Added the /MP (MultiProcess Compiling) flag to all projects to save build time.
  * Bug Fix: Image Generator always said it supports JPEG (without checking the sensor itself).
  * Fix a memory leak (about 180 bytes per generator).

Version 5.0.3.4 (Stable version - Jul 5th 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
  * Windows Redist: Support for 64-bit systems.
  * Control mutex is now per sensor and not global to all sensors.

Version 5.0.3.3 (Stable version - Jul 5th 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
  * Linux: Allow installation to a different directory (for cross-compilation mainly).
  * Workaround firmware bug: if no depth, IR timestamps are corrupt. Use host clock for timestamps instead.
  * Bug Fix: unregistering USB event callback when destroying sensor to prevent crash when unplugging device.
  * XnExportedSensorDevice now only enumerates devices that weren't created in the context yet.

Version 5.0.2.3 (Stable version - May 3rd 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
  * Fixed use of deprecated CreateProductionTree().
  * Bug Fix: playing XNS files in applications using deprecated API might cause memory leaks.
  * Bug Fix: serial number was in hex format instead of decimal one.
  * Make sure SensorV2 nodes will only use SensorV2 device (up to now they only checked it's a PrimeSense device).

Version 5.0.1.33 (Unstable version - Apr 18th 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
  * CE4100: adding support in makefiles, redist and install.
  * CE4100: default is now BULK with compressed formats.
  
Version 5.0.1.32 (Unstable version - Apr 11th 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
  * Fixing log prints of resolutions (-1 appeared as MAX_UINT64...) to the resolution name.
  * Linux Bug Fix: Server creates two log files, one in the client folder and one in /var/log/primesense/XnSensorServer
  * Fixed a memory leak when rewinding old XNS files.
  * Win32: WIX installer (replacing NSIS)
  * Fixed wrong version in XnDeviceFile

Version 5.0.1.31 (Stable version - Apr 11th 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
  * Fix BULK timeout - it was too small...
  * Bug Fix: IR only works in QVGA...
  * Added 64bit support for the installers.
  * Fix wrong uses of the XN_IS_STATUS_OK macro (value is evaluated twice).
  * Adding support for MJPEG pass-through.
  * Adding initial support for new CMOS interfaces
  * Adding initial JPEG support
  * Fix for UAC installer problems.
  * Fixed uninstall without OpenNI.
  * Set minimum OpenNI version check in the installer.
  * Fix seeking to first frame in old XNS files.
  * Bug Fix: Client would fail to connect if trying to connect while server is shutting down.
  * Improving the timestamps algorithm.
  * performance improvement when enumerating for image nodes - a sensor should only be checked once.
  * improving error message for setting grayscale8 in low resolutions.
  * Improve thread-safety when starting server
  * Bug Fix: a crash when trying to open a non-existing XNS file.
  * Bug Fix: a potential crash if Init of depth generator fails.
  * Sensor now supports the Device Identification capability.
  * Server: fixing a deadlock problem between closing a stream and getting new data from it. This was done by splitting the sensor lock into two locks: one for changes on the sensor and one for changing the stream collection.
  * MultiProcess Bug Fix: the lock on a sensor didn't exist, so nothing was synchronized.
  * ImageGenerator now also changes InputFormat when changing resolution if needed (when switching from hi-res to normal & vice versa).
  * Adding frame IDs to Audio (just counting)
  * restoring defaults to QVGA.
  * Add support for sensors with no image CMOS.
  * Updated low-bandwidth USB devices buffer information.
  * Added the Asus WAVI auto-detection for Win32.
  * Low bandwidth devices now use bigger USB delays.
  * New defaults are now VGA, uncompressed.
  * Initial support for low-band devices:
    1. Image, IR and audio does not enumerate.
    2. Defaults changed to QVGA, compressed.

Version 5.0.0.25 (Unstable version - Jan 6th 2011)
--------------------------------------------------
  * Bug fix: infinite loop in server when a client tries to disconnect and streams can't be closed (usb timeout for example).
  * Added MacOSX platform support.
  * Added the unstable README file.
  * Removed useless win32 prerequisites...
  * Fixing audio to work properly in the client-server model.
  * Server Bug Fix: a potential dead lock was solved.
  * Sensor Server now supports multiple sensors. 
  * Refactored server to a better design, which should decrease deadlocks and make code more readable.
  * Adding support for enumerating and opening different sensors.
  * Bug Fix: GetStringProperty would always return XN_STATUS_ERROR.

Version 5.0.0.24 (Stable version - Dec 8th 2010)
------------------------------------------------
  * Initial release...
